# Objective

- Determine if electricity usage changed after June 2024
- Explore changes by day of week
- Adjust for seasonal variation (colder months pre-June)

---
# Data Overview

- Time range: Oct 2023 – July 2025
- Frequency: Half-hour readings aggregated to daily totals
- Metric: kWh used per day

# Summary of Findings

- 📈 After adjusting for seasonality, usage increased by **3.2 kWh/day**
- 📊 Saturday showed highest post-June increase
- ❄️ Raw comparison is misleading due to colder months before June 2024

---
# Next Steps

- Extend data further back (pre-2023) for better seasonal control
- Investigate drivers of increased usage (e.g. occupancy, habits)
- Monitor for continued trends over winter 2025
